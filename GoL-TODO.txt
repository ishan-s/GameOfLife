TODO
===
- Make the grid & cell size customizable : Sliders would be great.
* NOTE: Most of the calculations are already done with variables, should not need major modifications.

- Add statistics : seed population, currently alive cells, max population, time cycles, time cycle of max population, time cycle of apocalypse.
- When population reaches zero : Reset the Live! button, stop animation, Game over dialogue/popup(?)
- Randomized seeding
- Feature to seed well-known shapes : gliders, LWSS, beacons, etc. [PARITALLY DONE]
  - Seed more shapes -> golshapes.js
- Stylize the page : Statistics section, control panel (!)


BUGS
===
- IE: Controls div not properly aligned [FIXED]
- FF: Canvas.onClick is not doing anything
- Directly changing the slider at frozen/stopped state messes up the live/freeze cycle. [FIXED]
