TODO
===
- Make the grid & cell size customizable : Sliders would be great. [TESTED : NOT WORTH THE EFFORT]
* NOTE: Most of the calculations are already done with variables, should not need major modifications.

- Add statistics : seed population, currently alive cells, max population, time cycles, time cycle of max population, time cycle of apocalypse.
- When population reaches zero : Reset the Live! button, stop animation, Game over dialogue/popup(?)
- Randomized seeding [PARTIALLY DONE]
- Feature to seed well-known shapes : gliders, LWSS, beacons, etc. [PARITALLY DONE]
  - Seed more shapes -> golshapes.js
  - Ability to mirror/re-orient shapes.
- Stylize the page : Statistics section, control panel (!)
*NOTE: Really really need to cleanup the styling part. Move all/most internal styling to external css.

- Better UI for shapes to drag & drop.
- Improve the ranomized seeding algorithm
- Color picker for cell color
- Evolution color / Pride or "Marijuana" mode? ;
- Code cleanup : golmain.js is getting messy. Re-org code blocks.

BUGS
===
- IE: Controls div not properly aligned [FIXED]
- FF: Canvas.onClick is not doing anything
- Directly changing the slider at frozen/stopped state messes up the live/freeze cycle. [FIXED]
